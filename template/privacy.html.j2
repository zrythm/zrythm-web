    4. Information we collect
  </h2>
  <h3>4.1 Umami</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
      Umami is processing the following personal data:
      <ul>
        <li>IP address
        <li>Location of the user
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      And also:
      <ul>
        <li>Date and time
        <li>Title of the page being viewed
        <li>URL of the page being viewed
        <li>URL of the page that was viewed prior to the current page
        <li>Screen resolution
        <li>Time in local timezone
        <li>Files that were clicked and downloaded
        <li>Link clicks to an outside domain
        <li>Pages generation time
        <li>Country, region, city
        <li>Main Language of the browser
        <li>User Agent of the browser
      </ul>
    </p>
  </div>
  <h3>4.2 Accounts</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
      If you make a Zrythm account, we collect your email address,
      first name and last name. Details about your session, including
      when you logged in or out will be collected.
    </p>
  </div>
  <h3>4.3 Purchases</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
      If you make a purchase, we additionally collect transaction
      information provided to us by Stripe, BTCPay or PayPal,
      such as a reference number.
    </p>
  </div>
  <h3>4.4 Information sent by the software</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
      If you use the Zrythm DAW provided by us, the
      program will attempt to contact
      zrythm.org at startup to determine if you should be notified
      about a new release of the software. If the computer where you
      use Zrythm is connected to the internet, this process will
      store the computer's internet address and an identifier for
      its operating system. This is covered under 'Server logs' below.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you experience an error in the software,
      the program will allow you to send an error report
      automatically. This process will store the computer's
      internet address and an identifier for its operating
      system. This is covered under
      'Server logs' below.
    </p>
    <p>
      The error data, such as logs, backtraces,
      and information you provide do not normally contain
      personal information. There is a possibility that the
      logs contain potentially sensitive information such as
      file paths, your username, etc. The program provides
      the capability to view the data before sending.
    </p>
  </div>
  <h3>4.5 Server logs</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
      The web servers that host the various websites and
      services we provide collect IP addresses of visitors
      and users who interact with them. This operation is
      required in order to communicate with clients - without
      access to the IP data websites and web services will
      not work. Our web servers maintain access logs, error
      logs and security logs.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2 class="page_subtitle">
    5. How we use your personal information
  </h2>
  <h3>5.1 Umami</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
      Umami is used to analyse the behaviour of the website visitors to identify potential
      pitfalls; not found pages, search engine indexing issues, and which contents are the most
      appreciated, etc. Once the data is processed (number of visitors reaching a not found pages,
      viewing only one page, etc.), Umami is generating reports for website owners to take
      action, for example changing the layout of the pages, publishing some fresh content, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      The processing of personal data with Umami is based on legitimate interests.
    </p>
    <p>
      Processing your personal data is helping us identify what is working and what is not on our
      website. For example, it helps us identify if the way we are communicating is engaging or
      not and how we can organize the structure of the website better. We are benefiting
      from the processing of your personal data, and we are directly acting on the website. By
      processing your personal data, you can profit from a website which is getting better and
      better.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your data will be used only to improve the user experience on our website and help you find
      the information you are looking for.
    </p>
  </div>
  <h3>5.2 Purchases</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
      We use your personal information only to establish and
      maintain your account used to access your orders at accounts.zrythm.org.
    </p>
    <p>
      We do not use your personal data for marketing purposes
      and we do not share your personal information with any third
      party, unless required by law.
    </p>
  </div>
  <h3>5.3 Error reports</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
      We store error reports sent via the software in our
      databases privately and securely.
      We use the information, which may or may
      not include potentially sensitive information, to help
      us fix
      issues with the software and improve its stability.
      After manually processing an error report, it will be
      permanently deleted and a public issue may be created
      in our issue trackers to manage it better.
      Parts that in our judgement do not contain sensitive
      information (such as backtraces and other internal
      program states) may
      be copied to our public issue trackers to provide
      more context. By submitting
      an error report, you agree that we may use
      the information you provide in this way.
    </p>
  </div>
  <h3>5.4 Server logs</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
      We store and maintain server logs for auditing and
      security purposes, and generally to keep our servers
      secure.
