"cURL supports many crypto backends. GNUnet requires the use of GnuTLS, but "

"backends would again expose us to a wider array of security issues, may "
"create licensing issues and most importantly introduce new bugs as some "
"crypto backends are known to introduce subtle runtime issues. While it is "
"possible to have two versions of libcurl installed on the same system, this "
"is error-prone, especially as if we are linked against the wrong version, "
"the bugs that arise might be rather subtle."
msgstr ""

#: template/gnurl.html.j2:37
msgid ""
"For GNUnet, we also need a particularly modern version of GnuTLS. Thus, it "
"would anyway be necessary to recompile cURL for GNUnet. But what happens if "
"one links cURL against this version of GnuTLS? Well, first one would install "
"GnuTLS by hand in the system. Then, we build cURL. cURL will build against "
"it just fine, but the linker will eventually complain bitterly. The reason "
"is that cURL also links against a bunch of other system libraries (gssapi, "
"ldap, ssh2, rtmp, krb5, sasl2, see discussion on obscure protocols above), "
"which --- as they are part of the distribution --- were linked against an "
"older version of GnuTLS. As a result, the same binary would be linked "
"against two different versions of GnuTLS. That is typically a recipe for "
"disaster. Thus, in order to avoid updating a dozen system libraries (and "
"having two versions of those installed), it is necessary to disable all of "
"those cURL features that GNUnet does not use, and there are many of those. "
"For GNUnet, the more obscure protocols supported by cURL are close to dead "
"code --- mostly harmless, but not useful. However, as some application may "
"use one of those features, distributions are typically forced to enable all "
"of those features, and thus including security issues that might arise from "
"that code."

"So to use a modern version of GnuTLS, a sane approach is to disable all of "
"the \"optional\" features of cURL that drag in system libraries that link "
"against the older GnuTLS. That works, except that one should then NEVER "
"install that version of libcurl in say /usr or /usr/local, as that may break "
"other parts of the system that might depend on these features that we just "
"disabled. Libtool versioning doesn't help here, as it is not intended to "
"deal with libraries that have optional features. Naturally, installing cURL "
"somewhere else is also problematic, as we now need to be really careful that "
"the linker will link GNUnet against the right version. Note that none of "

"How does forking fix it? Easy. First, we can get rid of all of the "

"with the original cURL. Those that do not, can choose to move to something "
"simpler. As the library gets a new name, we do not have to worry about tons "

"saying that \"libgnurl = libcurl with only HTTP/HTTPS support and GnuTLS\" "
"fixes 99%% of the problems that darkened my mood. Note that this pretty much "
"CANNOT be done without a fork, as renaming is an essential part of the fix. "
"Now, there might be creative solutions to achieve the same thing within the "
