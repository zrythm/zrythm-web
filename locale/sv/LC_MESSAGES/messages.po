"Zrythm is a native GNU/Linux application built using C and the GTK+3 toolkit "
"and borrows ideas, concepts and code from other projects such as Ardour and "
"Jalv. It is designed to be intuitive to use and is built with the intention "
"to provide GNU/Linux users a full-featured alternative to proprietary DAWs, "
