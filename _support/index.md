Donations are accepted and welcome as tokens of appreciation. They help me allocate more time to Zrythm development and also help keep me motivated and focused. They can be made through
- [PayPal](https://paypal.me/alextee90) - direct donation to me
- [LiberaPay](https://liberapay.com/alextee) - preferred platform for recurring donations (operated by a non-profit organization with source code available)
- [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/alextee) - recurring donations platform, not recommended but most popular

Contributions can also be made through translating Zrythm, submitting bug reports and feature requests, editing this website, editing the [manual](https://docs.zrythm.org) or submitting songs to be published here. PRs are also welcome from developers. Visit the [chatrooms](https://gitlab.com/alextee/zrythm#chatrooms) to get involved.
